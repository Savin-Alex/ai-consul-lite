# AI Consul Lite - Implementation Complete Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

### Local Model Selection Feature
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and ready to use

**What was added:**
- "Default Local Model Name" input field in options page
- Model preference saved to `chrome.storage.sync`
- Service worker uses: `sessionLocalModel || defaultLocalModel || 'llama3:latest'`
- Connection test validates selected model
- Error messages show model name in use

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/options/options.jsx` - Added model input field
2. `src/lib/llm_service.js` - Added model resolution from storage  
3. `src/background/service-worker.js` - Uses resolved model for Ollama calls

## üöß Started But Not Completed

### Streaming Infrastructure
**Status**: Created but not integrated

**Why:**
- Service workers have strict module import rules
- Dynamic imports in port listeners caused crash (Chrome error 15)
- Removed port listener to restore service worker functionality

**What exists:**
- `src/lib/streaming.js` - Complete streaming functions for all 4 providers
- Streaming functions are ready to use but not yet wired up

**Next step to complete:**
- Import streaming functions at top of service-worker.js (static import)
- Re-add port listener with proper imports
- Wire content script to use port connection
- Test with all providers

## üìù Documentation Created

Multiple documentation files were created to track progress:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Overall feature tracking
- `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` - What was done session by session  
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - How to test the new features
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - State when implementation paused
- `FINAL_STATUS.md` - Final summary of what works

## üéØ What You Can Do Now

### Test the Local Model Selection
1. Open extension options (`chrome://extensions` ‚Üí Options)
2. Select "Local LLM (Ollama)"
3. Enter model name like `llama3:latest` or `llama3.1:8b`
4. Save settings
5. Test connection
6. Use in WhatsApp to verify it uses your model

### Use the Extension
- Existing features all work
- Model selection is the new addition
- Streaming planned for future iteration

## üí° Recommendations

**For now:**
- Test the local model selection feature
- Extension fully functional with non-streaming API calls

**For future:**
- Re-implement streaming with static imports
- Add sidebar UI for advanced features  
- Implement page context scraping
- Add context menu actions

## üìä Commit History

Successfully committed and pushed:
- Local model selection implementation
- Streaming module creation (not yet used)
- Documentation files
- Service worker fix (removed problematic port listener)

Commit: `5a9f715` - "Add local model selection feature"

## ‚ú® Key Achievement

You now have the ability to:
- Choose which Ollama model to use from the options page
- The setting persists across browser sessions
- Error messages tell you which model failed
- Connection test validates your model choice

This makes Local LLM a first-class citizen alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers!
