# Current Status - AI Consul Lite Streaming Implementation

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

### 1. Local Model Selection ‚≠ê
- **DONE**: Options page, storage, service worker integration
- **TESTABLE**: Ready for you to try right now!

### 2. Streaming Backend
- **DONE**: Created `src/lib/streaming.js` with all 4 providers
- **DONE**: Added port-based listener in service worker
- **PROGRESS**: ReplyPanel now has streaming state management
- **REMAINING**: Wire content script to actually call streaming

### 3. UI Updates
- **DONE**: Added streaming progress display to ReplyPanel
- **DONE**: Added CSS for streaming animation
- **PROGRESS**: State management for incremental chunks
- **REMAINING**: Parse chunks and split by `---` as they arrive

## üîÑ Current State

The extension is in a transitional state:
- Non-streaming path: ‚úÖ Works (existing code)
- Streaming path: üöß Partially implemented
  - Backend ready
  - UI ready
  - Missing: Content script integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If You Test Now

**Non-streaming (current default)**: 
- Everything works as before
- Uses the existing `handleGenerate` path
- No streaming, just regular API calls

**If streaming were enabled**:
- UI would show streaming progress
- But content script doesn't have the port connection logic yet
- Would need to add that integration

## üìù Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Add streaming handler to content script**
   - Create function that opens port `STREAM_SUGGESTIONS`
   - Listen for `CHUNK` and `DONE` messages
   - Update progress text as chunks arrive

2. **Parse streaming chunks incrementally**
   - As text arrives, split by `---` to identify suggestion boundaries
   - Show partial suggestions as they're being written
   - Finalize when `DONE` arrives

3. **Add fallback**
   - If streaming fails, automatically fall back to non-streaming
   - This ensures backward compatibility

4. **Test all providers**
   - OpenAI streaming
   - Anthropic streaming
   - Google streaming
   - Ollama streaming

## üí° Recommendation

Since we've added a lot of infrastructure but not completed the integration, I suggest:
1. **Test the local model selection first** - it's fully working
2. Then either:
   - Complete streaming integration (15-20 more minutes)
   - OR commit current progress and tackle streaming later

Both paths are valid! The local model selection is a real feature you can use today.
